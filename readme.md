# GSC Logger: A Tool To Log Google Search Console Data to BigQuery
Google App Engine provides a Cron service for logging daily Google Search Console(GSC): Search Analytics data to BigQuery for use in
Google Data Studio or for separate analysis beyond 3 months.

## Configuration

This script runs daily and pulls data as specified in config.py file to BigQuery.  There is little to configure without some programming experience.  
Generally, this script is designed to be a set-it-and-forget-it in that once deployed to app engine, you should be able to add your service account
email as a full user to any GSC project and the Search Analytics data will be logged daily to BigQuery.  By default the data is set to pull from GSC 7 days earler every day 
to ensure the data is available.

* **Note: This script should be deployed on the Google Account with access to your GSC data to ensure it is available to Google Data Studio**
* **Note: This script has not been widely tested and is considered a POC.  Use at your own risk!!!**
* **Note: This script only works for Python 2.7 which is a restriction for GAE currently**

### 4. Deploy to App Engine

1. Configure the `gcloud` command-line tool to use the project your Firebase project.
```
$ gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```
2. Change directory to `appengine/`
```
$ cd appengine/
```
3. Install the Python dependencies
```
$ pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create an App Engine App
```
$ gcloud app create
```
5. Deploy the application to App Engine.
```
$ gcloud app deploy app.yaml \cron.yaml \index.yaml
